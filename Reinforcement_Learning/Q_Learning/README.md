# Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a Q-learning agent on the OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 environment. The Q-learning algorithm is used to teach the agent to efficiently navigate and complete tasks in the environment.

## Q-Learning

**Q-learning** is a classic reinforcement learning algorithm that enables an agent to learn optimal action-selection policies in Markov decision processes. In the context of this project:

- **Q-Table:** The agent maintains a Q-table, a 2D array where each row corresponds to a state in the environment, and each column corresponds to a possible action. The entries in the table represent the expected cumulative rewards for taking a specific action in a specific state.

- **Learning Process:** During training, the agent explores the environment, takes actions, and updates Q-values based on the observed rewards and transitions. The Q-learning update rule is applied to adjust the Q-values iteratively.

- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:** The agent balances exploration and exploitation. It occasionally explores new actions to discover potentially better policies (exploration), and it exploits learned values to make optimal decisions based on its current knowledge.

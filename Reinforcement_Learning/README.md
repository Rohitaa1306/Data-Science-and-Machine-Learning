# Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains implementations of both Q-learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for solving reinforcement learning problems. The models are applied to the OpenAI Gym environments for training and evaluation.

## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning concerned with training agents to make decisions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent learns by interacting with the environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions. The objective is to discover a strategy (policy) that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Agent:** The entity that learns and makes decisions. In your implementation, this is the Q-learning or Deep Reinforcement Learning model.

2. **Environment:** The external system with which the agent interacts. It provides feedback to the agent in the form of rewards or penalties.

3. **State:** A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment.

4. **Action:** The decision or move made by the agent at a given state.

5. **Reward:** A numerical value that quantifies the immediate benefit or cost of an action.

6. **Policy:** The strategy or mapping from states to actions that the agent learns.

7. **Q-Values:** In Q-learning, these are values associated with state-action pairs, representing the expected cumulative reward.

8. **Neural Networks:** Used in Deep Reinforcement Learning, neural networks approximate Q-values, allowing agents to handle complex state spaces.

## Q-Learning

The Q-learning algorithm is a classic reinforcement learning approach used for teaching agents optimal action-selection policies in Markov decision processes.


## Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning involves training agents using neural networks to approximate Q-values, enabling them to handle complex environments.

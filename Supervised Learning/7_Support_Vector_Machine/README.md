# Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

## 1. **Objective:**
   SVMs are designed to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes in a feature space. The goal is to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class.

### 2. **Hyperplane:**
   - In a two-dimensional space, the hyperplane is a simple line.
   - In a three-dimensional space, it becomes a plane.
   - In higher-dimensional spaces, it's referred to as a hyperplane.

   The SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

### 3. **Support Vectors:**
   Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (the hyperplane). These are the most critical points for determining the optimal hyperplane and, in turn, the SVM model.

### 4. **Margin:**
   The margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data point from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin, providing a robust and generalizable separation between classes.

### 5. **Kernel Trick:**
   SVMs can efficiently handle non-linear decision boundaries by using a kernel trick. This involves transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space, making non-linear relationships linearly separable. Common kernel functions include Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoid.

### 6. **C Parameter:**
   SVMs have a regularization parameter, denoted as 'C,' that controls the trade-off between having a smooth decision boundary and classifying training points correctly. A smaller C value allows a more flexible decision boundary, potentially misclassifying some points, while a larger C value enforces a stricter boundary.

### 7. **Soft Margin and Hard Margin:**
   - A Hard Margin SVM aims to find a hyperplane with no misclassifications, which may lead to overfitting, especially in noisy datasets.
   - A Soft Margin SVM allows for some misclassifications to achieve a better generalization to unseen data. The regularization parameter C controls the extent of this flexibility.

## 8. **Applications:**
   SVMs find applications in various domains, including:
   - Text classification and sentiment analysis.
   - Image classification and object detection.
   - Bioinformatics for protein structure prediction.
   - Finance for predicting stock prices.

## 9. **Pros and Cons:**
   - **Pros:** Effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust against overfitting, and versatile due to the kernel trick.
   - **Cons:** Computationally expensive for large datasets, sensitivity to noise, and the need for appropriate kernel selection.

In summary, Support Vector Machines excel in finding optimal decision boundaries with a focus on maximizing the margin, making them powerful tools for classification tasks across diverse domains. The flexibility introduced by the kernel trick enhances their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

## Implementation Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on a dataset related to diabetes diagnosis. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about individuals and their symptoms related to diabetes. Features such as age, gender, and various symptoms are utilized to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## SVM for Classification

Support Vector Machines are binary classification algorithms that aim to find a hyperplane that separates two classes with the maximum margin. In this project, SVM is utilized for diabetes diagnosis. The optimization problem involves finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin while ensuring correct classification of data points.

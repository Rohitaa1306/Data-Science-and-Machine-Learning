# SVM Classification

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification on a dataset related to diabetes diagnosis. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about individuals and their symptoms related to diabetes. Features such as age, gender, and various symptoms are utilized to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.

### Features:
- Age
- Gender
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Sudden Weight Loss
- Weakness
- Polyphagia
- Genital Thrush
- Visual Blurring
- Itching
- Irritability
- Delayed Healing
- Partial Paresis
- Muscle Stiffness
- Alopecia
- Obesity

### Target Variable:
- Class: Diagnosis of diabetes (Positive/Negative)

## SVM for Classification

Support Vector Machines are binary classification algorithms that aim to find a hyperplane that separates two classes with the maximum margin. In this project, SVM is utilized for diabetes diagnosis. The optimization problem involves finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin while ensuring correct classification of data points.

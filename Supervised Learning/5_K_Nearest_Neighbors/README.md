# Wine Quality Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors

## Dataset Overview
The Wine Quality dataset contains information about red wines, including various chemical properties and a quality score. The dataset consists of 12 variables:

1. Fixed Acidity
2. Volatile Acidity
3. Citric Acid
4. Residual Sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free Sulfur Dioxide
7. Total Sulfur Dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol
12. Quality (Target Variable)

The quality variable represents the wine's perceived quality on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating better quality.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

### Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric and supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It predicts the label or value of a data point based on the majority vote or average value of its k-nearest neighbors in the training dataset.

### How KNN Works
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and scaling features.

2. **Choose the Value of K:**
   - Select the value of k based on the dataset size and problem characteristics. Small k values provide flexible decision boundaries, while large k values create more rigid boundaries.

3. **Calculate Distances:**
   - Use distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski) to calculate distances between the query data point and training data points.

4. **Find K-Nearest Neighbors:**
   - Identify the k-nearest neighbors of the query data point based on calculated distances.

5. **Majority Vote (Classification) or Average (Regression):**
   - For classification, predict the label based on the majority vote of k-nearest neighbors. For regression, predict the value based on the average of k-nearest neighbors.

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.

### Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is associated with a corresponding output label. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling it to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

#### Classification

**Definition:** Classification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to categorize input data into predefined classes or labels.

**Mathematical Explanation:**
In classification, the algorithm aims to find a decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. The decision boundary is typically represented by a hyperplane, and the goal is to assign each input data point to a specific class based on its features.

One common mathematical representation is the linear equation for a decision boundary in a two-dimensional space:

f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b

- f(x) is the decision function,
- x_1 and x_2 are the input features,
- w_1 and w_2 are the weights, and
- b is the bias term.

The algorithm learns the optimal values for w and b during training to achieve accurate classifications.

#### Regression

**Definition:** Regression is another type of supervised learning where the algorithm predicts a continuous output value instead of assigning a label to input data.

**Mathematical Explanation:**
In regression, the algorithm aims to learn a mapping from input features to a continuous output variable. A common mathematical representation for a linear regression model in a simple one-dimensional space is:

f(x) = wx + b

- f(x) is the predicted output,
- x is the input feature,
- w is the weight, and
- b is the bias term.

The algorithm adjusts the values of w and b during training to minimize the difference between predicted and actual output values.

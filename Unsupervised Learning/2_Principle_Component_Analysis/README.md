# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique employed in this project to enhance the efficiency of the machine learning model, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. PCA transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components, which capture the most significant variance in the data.

## Dataset
The Wine Quality (Red) dataset serves as the foundation for this project, offering insights into various chemical and physical properties of red wines. The dataset includes features that can be indicative of wine quality, making it a valuable resource for predictive modeling and analysis.

## PCA model steps:

1. **Center the Data:**
   - Subtract the mean from each feature, centering the data around the origin.

2. **Compute Covariance Matrix:**
   - Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between different features.

3. **Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:**
   - Determine the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, while eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of variance in those directions.

4. **Sort Eigenvectors:**
   - Sort the eigenvectors based on their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. The highest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction of maximum variance (first principal component).

5. **Select Top k Eigenvectors:**
   - Choose the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, where k is the desired number of dimensions in the reduced space.

6. **Transform Data:**
   - Transform the original data into the reduced space by multiplying it by the selected eigenvectors. This results in a new set of uncorrelated variables, the principal components.

## Purpose of PCA

1. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - The original dataset contains multiple features, each contributing to the complexity of the model.
   - PCA aims to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information, simplifying the model and potentially improving its performance.

2. **Collinearity Mitigation:**
   - PCA addresses multicollinearity by creating orthogonal (uncorrelated) principal components. This helps to eliminate redundancy in the feature space.

3. **Variance Maximization:**
   - Principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain. The first few components often capture the majority of the dataset's variability.

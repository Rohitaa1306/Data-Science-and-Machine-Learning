# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique employed in this project to enhance the efficiency of the machine learning model, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. PCA transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components, which capture the most significant variance in the data.

## Purpose of PCA

1. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - The original dataset contains multiple features, each contributing to the complexity of the model.
   - PCA aims to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information, simplifying the model and potentially improving its performance.

2. **Collinearity Mitigation:**
   - PCA addresses multicollinearity by creating orthogonal (uncorrelated) principal components. This helps to eliminate redundancy in the feature space.

3. **Variance Maximization:**
   - Principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain. The first few components often capture the majority of the dataset's variability.

## Implementation in the Project

### Steps:

1. **Standardization:**
   - Features are standardized (mean-centered and scaled) before applying PCA to ensure that all features contribute equally.

2. **Number of Components:**
   - The number of principal components is a crucial parameter. In this project, `n_components` is set to 5 during PCA.

3. **Impact Visualization:**
   - Explained variance ratio is visualized to understand how much variance each principal component captures, aiding in determining the optimal number of components.

4. **Integration with KNN:**
   - The standardized features are transformed using the PCA results before feeding into the KNN classifier.

## Results and Impact

- PCA leads to a reduction in the number of features from 11 to 8 in this project.
- The reduction in dimensionality positively impacts the accuracy of the KNN classifier, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing essential information with fewer dimensions.
